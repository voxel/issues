issues
======

an issue tracker and discussion forum for voxel.js related topics that don't fit in any particular repo

voxel-engine and all of the other voxel related repos should live on the module authors' github accounts, this organization is just for meta stuff

see https://github.com/voxel/issues/issues to browse and create issues here

see also: https://github.com/voxel/ideas issue tracker for new voxel.js plugin ideas
